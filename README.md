# Newsfeed Demos

This repository contains a collection of demos for different ways to create a newsfeed app. It includes multiple different API frameworks, as well as multiple different app frameworks.

The principal behind this repository is the same idea as projects like the [todo backend project](https://www.todobackend.com/). It's a way to compare and contrast different frameworks and approaches to building the same app.
